# Python API Homework - What's the Weather Like?

Using OpenWeatherMap API, I have analyzed 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator to create a representative model of weather across the world. 

WeatherPy

In studying the scatter plots of 500+ cities in relation to their distance from the equator, my analysis showed a positive correlation to temperature the closer they are to the equator. Humidity and Cloudiness % exists everywhere but appears to be more dense in the northern hemisphere. Wind speed did not show a correlation relative to its distance from the equator.

VacationPy

In this analysis, I extracted cities with my ideal weather in mind.
  - Temperature between 65 and 90 degrees
  - Humidity less than 20%
  - Cloudiness less than 25%
  - Wind Speed less than 15mph

Then, using Google API, I found the nearest hotel based on their lat/longs. 

Finally, I created a heatmap of all the cities used in WeatherPy to represent the humidity across the world and plotted the hotels for my ideal weather spots!
